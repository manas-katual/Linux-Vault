# SGID

- We can change owner and co-owner of a directory
- We can also change owner and co-owner recursively
- When we change co-owner of a directory recursively, the objects inside the directory will inherit the co-owner from the directory.
- This is only applied on existing objects 
- Objects created after changing the co-owner will not inherit co-owner of the parent directory.
- If you want the new objects to inherit the co-owner of the parent directory whenever they are created , we apply **SGID** on the parent directory.
- It is applied on directories only

## Commands
`# chmod g+s /directory` to apply SGID
`# chmod g-s /directory` to remove SGID
`# chgrp hr /directory -R` to change co-owner recursively
`# chown ganesh /directory -R` to change owner recursively
`# chown 700 /directory -R` to change permissions recursively
