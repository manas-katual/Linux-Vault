# Directory permission

**There are 3 operations that a user can perform on a directory :**
- Read (list contents of a directory)
- Write (create, delete, modify content in a directory)
- Execute (enter into a directory)

**There are 3 basic permissions on a directory :**
- read (r)
- write (w)
- execute (x)

**Valid sets of permission :**
1. rwx &rarr; full access
2. r-x &rarr; read and execute
3. ---x &rarr; execute only
4. --- &rarr full deny

==It is mandatory to have execute permission on a directory along with read and write==
