- Shell scripting is used to to run a bunch of commands
- If we want to run multiple commands with one single command we can use shell scripting

### Steps to create a script

1. Create a new text file using text editor
2. Write valid Linux commands 
3. Save the file
4. assign execute permission to the file


### Run a script

- we provide absolute path of the script
- we can make a script run as a command by copying or moving it to `/usr/bin` OR `/usr/sbin`
